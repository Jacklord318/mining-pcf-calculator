# ⛏️ Mining Carbon Footprint Calculator

This Streamlit web app estimates the product-level carbon footprint (CO₂e emissions) per ton of ore processed in the mining industry. It uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data and emission factors to provide results aligned with Product Lifecycle Accounting standards (e.g., GHG Protocol).

## 🚀 Features

- Activity-based carbon footprint estimation
- Breakdowns by life cycle stage (extraction, processing, transport, etc.)
- Monte Carlo uncertainty simulation (optional)
- Streamlit-powered interface for ease of use
